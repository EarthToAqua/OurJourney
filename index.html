      Our names are Adam and Grace.
      After falling madly in love with each other, but not so madly enough with the prospect of a normal job, one day we bought a one
      way ticket to Thailand. Here we learned all the skills we needed to become professional SCUBA divers. Working on a busy island in
      the diving industry gave us a satisfying taste of an alternative lifestyle. We embraced island life and every day we‚Äôd get out
      on the boat and explore the seas around us. As it turns out exploring was something we never got bored of and we realised that we
      could never stop. We were away from so many distractions back home and meeting wonderful, like-minded people. We had to keep on
      exploring. This was the birth of Earth To Aqua, we always enjoyed travelling but now we were on our longest trip
      yet and got used to being away from home fast. We wanted to continue sharing our experiences using photography. Providing content
      that shows the beauty of the natural world that is really just over the horizon, just waiting for you to visit. Now we have
      vowed to continue travelling for as long as we can and share our stories and treasures along the way. We hope to inspire you to
      get out there and experience some sudden life!
